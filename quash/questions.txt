Quash should support (at least) two built-in variables: PATH and HOME.
-Do we actually declare these variables within our quash.c and quash.h files, or does it mean we'll be manipulating the actual environmental variables through system calls?
-Do we need to fully comment everything to generate doxygen documentation?
-Can you just scroll through array and combine all arguments?
-Do we need to include all flags for cd and other calls?
